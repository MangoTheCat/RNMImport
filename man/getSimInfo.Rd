getSimInfo(obj, problemNum = 1, addRawInfo = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{Object of class NMRun, or NMSim*}

\item{problemNum}{Number of problem (applicable only when obj is of class NMRun)}

\item{addRawInfo}{Should the raw contents of the $SIM statement be added to the returned information?}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with 3 entries : numSimulations, seed1, and seed2.  These are self-explanatory.
